Java provides several methods to read files. Each of these methods is appropriate for reading different types of files in different situations.
Some are better for reading longer files, others are better for reading shorter ones, etc.

In this tutorial, we will be using the following Java classes to read files

BufferedReader
Files
Scanner

Throughout the tutorial, we are using a file stored in the src directory where the path to the file is src/file.txt.

Store several lines of text in this file before proceeding.

Note: You have to properly handle the errors when using these implementations to stick to the best coding practices.
