        Reading Text Files in Java with BufferedReader
        The BufferedReader class reads a character-input stream.
        It buffers characters in a buffer with a default size of 8 KB to make the reading process more efficient.
        If you want to read a file line by line, using BufferedReader is a good choice.

        BufferedReader is efficient in reading large files.
